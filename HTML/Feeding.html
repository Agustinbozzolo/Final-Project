				<h3>Seniors: A senior dog's diet may contain more high-quality proteins to fuel and maintain muscle mass but lower calories to account for less activity.  It is important for a healthy balance of fat, proteins, sodium, and phosphorus. Some senior dogs may benefit from feeding them smaller portions more frequently throughout the day.  This is also a good way to monitor their water intake in order to ensure proper hydration.</h3>
